- **Real-Time Tracking:** Monitor application progress and status updates in real-time.
- **Document Management:** Secure upload and management of required documents.
- **Automated Notifications:** Instant alerts for application progress, approvals, or required actions.

### AI Integration
- **Application Segregation:** AI categorizes applications based on institution type, size, and fire risk factors.
- **Risk Assessment:** AI-driven analysis of potential fire hazards and recommended safety measures.
- **Compliance Verification:** Automated document checks for completeness and adherence to regulations.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Uses historical data to predict fire risks and suggests preventive measures.
- **Smart Notifications:** AI-based alerts for high-risk applications and required actions.

### Future IoT Integration
- **IoT-Enabled Fire Detection:** Integration with smoke detectors, temperature sensors, and fire alarms.
- **Smart Sprinkler Systems:** Automated sprinklers with real-time monitoring and control.
- **Centralized Monitoring Dashboard:** Collects data from all IoT devices for real-time analysis.
- **Emergency Response Automation:** Automated alerts and systems control during fire emergencies.
